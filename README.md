# Crash-O-nauts

Installation:
If you just want to play the game, download the Build2.zip and run the .exe inside it. 

 

Build:
To build the Project these two Asset packs need to be bought:

Assetpack 1:
Polyperfect - Ultimate Low Poly Pack
Link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/low-poly-ultimate-pack-54733
Assetpack 2:
Kenney Character Assets
Link: https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-character-assets

Additionally the "Idle" "Walk" and "Run" animations from the Character Assets need to be set to looped.
For the Spaceship to fall apart and be repareble, You will have to cut up the shuttle into its part and create a prefab that contains the subparts as children.
Because an asset from the Polyperfect pack was cut up for this, we can't distribute these.
